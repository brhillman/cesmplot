# cesmplot
This project contains some tools to plot outputs from CESM (and SP-CAM) and compare with observations. The goal is to have a tool here that will allow me to quickly and easily compare results from multiple simulations against observations, without a lot of overhead, but will be flexible enough to do robust statistical analysis as well. In other words, something *like* the AMWG diagnostics package, but a bit more flexible so I can easily get a sneak peak at shorter runs as well, and so that I can easily grab the python code to make publication-ready one-off plots as needed.
